# Simple EOS escrow smart contract


This smart-contract is a part of **EOS Commercial Arbitration framework**.

Buyers and sellers can use this smart-contract to put down their funds in an
escrow. Later on, once the deal ended, both party can claim deposited funds.
When there is no dispute funds are transferred to requesting party. Otherwise,
parties can seek arbitration, in which case only a judge can decide who should
receive funds.

Warning: this is a work in progress. By no means, the smart-contract is ready
for production use or complete. Documentation in source code suggests missing
pieces and possible improvements.
